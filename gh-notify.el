;;; Commentary:

;; This is gh-notify: A thin ui veneer on top of Magit/Forge porcelain for juggling
;; large amounts of GitHub notifications.
;;
;; It provides a more efficient interface to the Magit/Forge notification database
;; suited for rapid searching/narrow/filter based workflows.  It also improves on
;; Magit/Forge's default notification fetching behavior by introducing support for
;; incremental notification fetching, which is a must for interactive notification
;; queue workflow iterations.
;;
;; This code should be plug and play if you already have Magit/Forge set up and have
;; fetched notifications for your GitHub account at least once.  If not, please see:
;; https://magit.vc/manual/forge.html to get started.
;;
;; Note: this requires the latest versions of magit/forge to be installed from melpa
;; as per Feb 18, 2021.
;;
;;; Usage:
;;
;; M-x gh-notify
;;
;; Please see README.org for documentation.

  "Major mode for manipulating GitHub notifications through Magit/Forge.

\\<gh-notify-mode-map>

Notifications are retrieved from Magit/Forge and displayed in an Emacs buffer,
one notification per line.  Display takes place in date/repo or repo/date
ordered fashion.

Notifications can be further filtered in realtime by a user-specified regular
expression and limited by certain criteria described below.  This mode tries to
remember point so that it keeps its associated notification selected across
filtering/limiting operations, assuming the notification is visible.

To minimize the feedback loop, this mode does not use the minibuffer for input
\(e.g.  when typing a filter regular expression).  You can start typing
immediately and the filter updates, visible on the header line.

Other than regular keys being bound to `gh-notify--self-insert-command', the
following commands are available:

Type \\[gh-notify-visit-notification] to switch to notification at point in
magit/forge.  With a prefix argument, switch to the topic associated to
notification through `browse-url'.

Type \\[gh-notify-retrieve-notifications] to retrieve local notifications from magit/forge.

Type \\[gh-notify-forge-refresh] to retrieve new remote notifications from GitHub.

Type \\[gh-notify-reset-filter] to kill the current Title/URL filter.

Type \\[gh-notify-toggle-url-view] to toggle notifications being shown as titles or API URLs.

Type \\[gh-notify-toggle-timing] to toggle timing information on the header line.

Type \\[gh-notify-copy-url] to copy API URL belonging to notification at point.

Type \\[gh-notify-ls-issues-at-point] to visit any other open issue associated
to the repo of the notification at point.  With a prefix any of all issues
associated to the repo of the notification at point.

Type \\[gh-notify-ls-pullreqs-at-point] to visit any other open pull request
associated to the repo of the notification at point.  With a prefix any of all
issues associated to the repo of the notification at point.

Limiting notifications:

Gh-notify operates on four layers of result limiting, a read-state limit, a
type limit, repo limit and a reason limit.

These are applied in repo -> state -> type -> reason order, which is generally
what you want.  This allows you to intuitively add and remove limits.  Repo
narrows to repo scope, state toggles for unread/read, type narrows for
notification type (issue, pullreq) and finally reason narrows on the reason
for the notification.

Repo limits:

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-repo] to add a repo to the repo limit.  With a prefix argument, remove
a repo from the repo limit.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-repo-none] to reset the repo limit to the default limit.

State limits:

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-unread] to limit to unread notifications.  With a prefix argument,
remove unread limit.

Reason limits:

Independently from the repo limit are the various reason limits.  These
correlate to the various notification reason states that may be associated
with a GitHub notification.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-issue] to limit to issue notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-pr] to limit to pull request notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-assign] to limit to assign notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-author] to limit to author notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-mention] to limit to mention notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-team-mention] to limit to team-mention notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-subscribed] to limit to subscribed notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-comment] to limit to comment notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-review-requested] to limit to review-requested notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-none] to remove any active reason limit.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-marked] to only show marked notifications.

Type \\[gh-notify-limit-none] to remove the current limit and show all notifications.

Marking:

Type \\[gh-notify-mark-notification] to mark notification at point.

Type \\[gh-notify-unmark-notification] to unmark notification at point.

Type \\[gh-notify-mark-all-notifications] to mark all notifications currently visible in Emacs.  If
there is a region, only mark notifications in region.

Type \\[gh-notify-unmark-all-notifications] to unmark all notifications currently visible in Emacs.
If there is a region, only unmark notifications in region.

Note: marking support is currently moot, but will be used to support bulk
actions.
